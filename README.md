## Introduction
For my final year project 2021, I took the lead in developing a web application aimed at enhancing the customer experience in the hospitality industry. The primary objective was to provide a convenient alternative to traditional telephone-based ordering systems. In this project, customers can easily place food orders, request room service, and inquire about available services using a user-friendly web interface.

## Features and Functionality
The web application offers the following key features:
1. Online Food Ordering: Customers can browse the menu, select their desired items, customize their orders, and place food orders through the web application.
2. Room Service Request: Guests can request various services, such as housekeeping, laundry, or maintenance, using the web application.
3. Service Inquiry: Customers can inquire about available facilities, amenities, and any other services provided by the hotel or establishment.
4. User Authentication: The application includes a secure authentication system to ensure authorized access and protect customer information.
5. Responsive Design: The web application is developed using HTML and CSS, ensuring a visually appealing and user-friendly interface that adapts to different screen sizes and devices.

## Development Tools and Technologies
To construct the web application, I utilized HTML and CSS as the primary programming languages. HTML was used for structuring the web pages and defining the content, while CSS was employed for styling and layout purposes. The combination of these technologies allowed me to create an attractive and intuitive user interface.

## Future Enhancements
Although the current version of the web application provides essential functionality, there is scope for further improvements. Potential enhancements include:
1. Integration with a backend system to handle order and service requests efficiently.
2. Implementation of a payment gateway to facilitate online payment for food orders.
3. Addition of a feedback or rating system for customers to share their experiences and provide valuable input.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, my final year project involved spearheading the development of a web-based hospitality service platform. The application allows customers to conveniently place food orders, request room service, and inquire about services using an intuitive web interface. The utilization of HTML and CSS ensured an engaging and responsive user experience. This project serves as a testament to my abilities in web development and showcases my commitment to improving customer satisfaction in the hospitality industry.
